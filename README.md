# Gossipsub tester

This program takes on the libp2p daemon with gossipsub to create a simple application to send messages to all other peers.

# Introduction

This is a simple tester that runs a gossip implementation, is able to publish messages passed on it to it via a RPC call, and can log received messages to a log file.

## Startup

The program takes a few arguments to start:
* the destination log file
* the list of peers to statically connect to
* The network interface to bind to
* The port on which it will listen for incoming gossip messages
* The port on which it will listen for RPC messages

## Execution

The program runs until it is interrupted by a signal from terminal, such as interrupt.

## Publishing messages

The program will publish messages using a POST RPC call under the path `/publish`.
The program will absorb the payload of the body and post it as is to all other peers.

## Logging messages

Messages are logged using JSON for easy ingestion.
The format of the JSON object is:
{"timestamp":<ISO 8601 timestamp>, "value":<payload received>}

This format may evolve over time.
